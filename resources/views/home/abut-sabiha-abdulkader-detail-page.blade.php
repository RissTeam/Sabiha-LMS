            <h1>About Sabiha Abdulkader</h1>
            <p>
              Greeting from Sabiha Abdulkader! Your internationally certified
              psychologist and trusted mental coach was born in the United Arab
              Emirates. With a wealth of experience spanning various sectors,
              I'm here to provide you with top-notch guidance and support.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a passion for empowering individuals, I bring a wealth of
              experience in family and psychological counselling, mental health,
              Neuro-linguistic programming, business coaching, and female
              development. My expertise is backed by a professional certified
              trainer from the esteemed International Academy for Training and
              Development in the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm working as a sought-after professional trainer at
              both the ASASCO Center and the Canadian Global Center. And the
              excitement doesn't stop there. I'm gearing up to take my insights
              and expertise to even greater heights, with plans to deliver
              engaging training sessions at the prestigious Dubai Knowledge
              Authority and The Hague University in Britain.
            </p>

            <p>
              But that is not all! With a hobby-turned-passion, I've completed
              multiple professional make-up courses and now proudly serve as a
              professional make-up artist in Dubai.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're on a quest for personal growth or seeking expert
              guidance, I'm here to guide you every step of the way. Let's team
              up and unleash your full potential – your journey to success
